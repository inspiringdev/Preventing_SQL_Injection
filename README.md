This code performs several key operations after the database is created:

Creating the Database and Tables:

The code creates a SQLite database (Information_Security.db) and ensures a permissions table exists, which stores user and file access permissions.
Inserting Test Data:

Test data is inserted into the permissions table for a user named "ubaid" with access to two files, file1 and file2. This mimics a system where file permissions are stored for validation purposes.
Session Token:

A session token is generated using the secrets.token_hex() function. This token is a way of validating whether the user session is legitimate. The token is passed along with file requests to simulate an active, valid session.
User Permission and File Access:

The get_file() function checks if the user has permission to access a specific file by querying the permissions table. It also checks if the session token is valid (though the token validation is mocked in this case). If the user doesn't have permission, an error is raised.
Failed Attempts and Lockout:

A mechanism to temporarily lock out users after multiple failed attempts is in place. After 3 failed attempts, the user is locked out for 5 minutes (LOCKOUT_TIME). This is tracked using the failed_attempts dictionary, which stores the number of failed attempts and the lockout time.
Database Role:

The database plays a crucial role in storing permissions for users. Whenever a user tries to access a file, the code queries the database to verify if the user has permission to access that file. Without proper permissions, access to the file is denied, adding a layer of security.
